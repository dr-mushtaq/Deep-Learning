## **Definition of neural networks** 
**Def:** Neural networks, also called artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning and are the backbone of deep learning algorithms. They are called ‚Äúneural‚Äù because they mimic how neurons in the brain signal one another. A neural network is a type of machine-learning algorithm that is inspired by the human brain. It is a network of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, that learn to recognize patterns in data. Neural networks are used in a wide variety of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

**Def:** Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of biological neural networks in the human brain.ANNs consist of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," that process and transmit information.

## **Definition of Deep learning**

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to tackle complex problems with large amounts of data. The motivation behind deep learning stems from the desire to replicate the human mind‚Äôs ability to learn and make decisions.

**Def:**  The term, Deep Learning, refers to training Neural Networks, sometimes very large Neural Networks.

**Def:** Deep learning refers to the process of involving a system that thinks and learns exactly like humans using an artificial neural network

**Def**: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. the ‚Äúdeep‚Äù in deep learning refers to the depth of layers in a neural network. 

 **Def:**  A neural network of more than three layers, including the inputs and the output, can be considered a deep-learning algorithm. 

**Def:** Deep learning is a subcategory of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to process large amounts of data. It enables machines to learn complex patterns and make decisions based on this data.

**Def:** Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on building and training neural networks with multiple layers. These neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, with each layer processing and transforming data in a hierarchical manner. Deep learning algorithms learn from vast amounts of labeled data to make predictions or decisions.

## **Why use Deep Learning**

Deep learning is particularly effective for analyzing massive, complex data, such as images, videos or text. It excels in fields such as facial recognition, machine translation and autonomous driving.

## **Difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning**

Deep learning and machine learning are both subfields of artificial intelligence (AI), but they differ significantly in their approach and capabilities. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of their key differences:

1. **Data Dependence**:

Machine Learning: Generally performs well with structured, labeled data. It requires features to be explicitly engineered by humans. While it can handle some unstructured data, its performance is often limited. 1, 2

Deep Learning: Thrives on large amounts of unstructured data. It automatically learns features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. This allows it to handle complex patterns and relationships that traditional machine learning struggles with. 1, 2

2. **Algorithm Complexity**:

Machine Learning: Employs relatively simpler algorithms. Examples include linear regression, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and random forests. 3

Deep Learning: Uses complex, multi-layered artificial neural networks. These networks have many layers (hence ‚Äúdeep‚Äù), allowing them to learn intricate hierarchical representations of data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data are prime examples. 3

3. **Feature Extraction**:

Machine Learning: Requires manual feature extraction. Data scientists must carefully select and engineer relevant features from the raw data before training the model. This is a time-consuming and often challenging process. 4

Deep Learning: Automatically learns features through multiple layers of the neural network. This eliminates the need for manual feature engineering, making it more efficient for complex data. 4

4. **Computational Power**:

Machine Learning: Can often be trained on relatively modest computational resources.

Deep Learning: Demands significantly more computational power due to the complexity of its algorithms and the large datasets it processes. This often requires specialized hardware like GPUs or TPUs. 5

5. **Interpretability**:

Machine Learning: Generally more interpretable. It‚Äôs often easier to understand how a simpler machine learning model arrives at its predictions.

Deep Learning: Often considered a ‚Äúblack box.‚Äù The intricate workings of deep neural networks can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand why a model makes a specific prediction. 4

In short: Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning. Machine learning is suitable for simpler tasks with structured data, while deep learning excels at complex tasks with large amounts of unstructured data, but requires significantly more computational resources. The choice between them depends on the specific problem and available resources.
