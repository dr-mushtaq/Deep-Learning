## **Definition of neural networks** 
**Def:** Neural networks, also called artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning and are the backbone of deep learning algorithms. They are called ‚Äúneural‚Äù because they mimic how neurons in the brain signal one another. A neural network is a type of machine-learning algorithm that is inspired by the human brain. It is a network of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, that learn to recognize patterns in data. Neural networks are used in a wide variety of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

**Def:** Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of biological neural networks in the human brain.ANNs consist of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," that process and transmit information.

## **Definition of Deep learning**

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to tackle complex problems with large amounts of data. The motivation behind deep learning stems from the desire to replicate the human mind‚Äôs ability to learn and make decisions.

## **Why use Deep Learning**

Deep learning is particularly effective for analyzing massive, complex data, such as images, videos or text. It excels in fields such as facial recognition, machine translation and autonomous driving.

## **Difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning**

Deep learning and machine learning are both subfields of artificial intelligence (AI), but they differ significantly in their approach and capabilities. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of their key differences:

1. **Data Dependence**:

Machine Learning: Generally performs well with structured, labeled data. It requires features to be explicitly engineered by humans. While it can handle some unstructured data, its performance is often limited. 1, 2

Deep Learning: Thrives on large amounts of unstructured data. It automatically learns features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. This allows it to handle complex patterns and relationships that traditional machine learning struggles with. 1, 2

2. **Algorithm Complexity**:

Machine Learning: Employs relatively simpler algorithms. Examples include linear regression, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and random forests. 3

Deep Learning: Uses complex, multi-layered artificial neural networks. These networks have many layers (hence ‚Äúdeep‚Äù), allowing them to learn intricate hierarchical representations of data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data are prime examples. 3

3. **Feature Extraction**:

Machine Learning: Requires manual feature extraction. Data scientists must carefully select and engineer relevant features from the raw data before training the model. This is a time-consuming and often challenging process. 4

Deep Learning: Automatically learns features through multiple layers of the neural network. This eliminates the need for manual feature engineering, making it more efficient for complex data. 4

4. **Computational Power**:

Machine Learning: Can often be trained on relatively modest computational resources.

Deep Learning: Demands significantly more computational power due to the complexity of its algorithms and the large datasets it processes. This often requires specialized hardware like GPUs or TPUs. 5

5. **Interpretability**:

Machine Learning: Generally more interpretable. It‚Äôs often easier to understand how a simpler machine learning model arrives at its predictions.

Deep Learning: Often considered a ‚Äúblack box.‚Äù The intricate workings of deep neural networks can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand why a model makes a specific prediction. 4

In short: Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning. Machine learning is suitable for simpler tasks with structured data, while deep learning excels at complex tasks with large amounts of unstructured data, but requires significantly more computational resources. The choice between them depends on the specific problem and available resources.

## **History of Deep learning**
The first ANN was proposed in 1944, but it has become very popular in recent years. Deep learning was introduced in the early 50s but it became popular in recent years due to the increase in AI-oriented applications and the data that is being generated by the companies. While classical machine learning algorithms fell short of analyzing big data, artificial neural networks performed well on big data. The history of deep learning can be traced back to the early days of artificial intelligence (AI). In 1943, **Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts** created a mathematical model of neurons in the brain, which was the first artificial neural network.

- In the 1950s, **Frank Rosenblatt developed the perceptron**, a simple two-layer neural network that could be trained to recognize patterns. However, the perceptron had limitations, and it was not until the 1980s that neural networks began to be used more widely.

- In the 1980s, **Geoffrey Hinton** and others developed a new type of neural network called the vbackpropagation algorithm**. Backpropagation allowed neural networks to learn more complex patterns, and it led to a renewed interest in neural networks.

In the 1990s, deep learning research continued, but it was still a relatively niche field. However, in the early 2000s, there were a number of breakthroughs that led to a resurgence of interest in deep learning.

One of the most important breakthroughs was the development of the convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are a type of neural network that is specifically designed for image processing. They have been used to achieve state-of-the-art results in a variety of image recognition tasks, such as face recognition and object detection.

Another important breakthrough was the development of the recurrent neural network (RNN). RNNs are a type of neural network that is specifically designed for processing sequential data. They have been used to achieve state-of-the-art results in a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation and speech recognition.

In the past decade, deep learning has made significant progress in a wide variety of tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine translation. It is now one of the most active and promising areas of research in AI.

Here are some of the major milestones in the history of deep learning:

1943: Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts create a mathematical model of neurons in the brain.

1958: Frank Rosenblatt develops the perceptron, a simple two-layer neural network that can be trained to recognize patterns.

1986: Geoffrey Hinton and others develop the backpropagation algorithm, which allows neural networks to learn more complex patterns.

1998: Yann LeCun et al. develop the LeNet-5 CNN, which achieves state-of-the-art results in handwritten digit recognition.

2006: Geoffrey Hinton et al. develop the Deep Belief Network, which is a type of neural network that can be pre-trained on a large amount of unlabeled data.

2012: Alex Krizhevsky et al. develop the AlexNet CNN, which achieves state-of-the-art results in image classification.

2014: Ilya Sutskever et al. develop the Transformer, a new type of neural network that is specifically designed for natural language processing tasks.

2015: Google Translate uses deep learning to achieve human-level performance in machine translation.

2016: AlphaGo defeats a professional Go player using deep learning.
